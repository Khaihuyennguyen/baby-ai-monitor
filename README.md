## About the Project
This project aims to create a baby monitor which is portable enough to be run off of a
Raspberry Pi. This baby monitor should be capable of analyzing the movements that a
baby makes and the environment surrounding the baby in order to alert the parents of
the babyâ€™s needs whenever there is a significant event. By recording the baby's
movements through a camera that data should be enough for a computer vision
machine learning System such as OpenCV to be able to detect whether or not the baby
requires parental assistance.

### Background : 
Parents often need extra help in caring for their baby, especially during times where
they need to get some rest. Parents can be inattentive towards their babies typically
during night hours because the parents need sleep. Baby monitors help parents by
waking them up and alerting them to any needs that the baby has. Additionally, it
allows parents to be in a different room than the baby allowing them to tend to other
tasks that they need to complete


## Constraints
Currently, there are some constraints that need to be considered. In some situations,
the baby room will be very dark, the camera might not work well in poor light
conditions. Another problem is that if the camera is not placed properly, they might
also record the baby which always has unexpected movement and might give the
parents constant false alarm. Last but not least, the baby monitor should be equipped
to handle a variety of outside environments as crib designs and sizes may vary.
